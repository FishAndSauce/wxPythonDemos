demo of how to drive a wxPython app from another script:

one thread to do the driving, one thread to run the Calculator:

the primary thread runs the GUI - - it gets "locked up" with the mainloop.

the secondary thread i used to do things in a way outside the GUI. In this
case, a simple pause and sending commands now and then. The commands are put
on the event loop with a wx.CallAfter() call.

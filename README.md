# wxPythonDemos
wxPython Demos: Various small demos of wxPython features -- dveloped over years of discussion on the wxPython-users mailinglist

These were put together over many years, and test / demostrate a wide variety or wxPython features.

Since they are so old, many have outdated style, and may not work with py3 and/or wxPython4

If you find a problem, please post an issue, or even better, a PR with a fix.

I hope they are useful to you.
